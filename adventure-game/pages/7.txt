You are in a space station. There are no other people around, and the state of
the various equipment indicates that no one has been for some time. The door on
your left reads "Space departures". The door on your left reads "Air duct".

Suddenly you hear a scream from the air duct.

=
Quickly! Into the air duct, someone may be in danger
