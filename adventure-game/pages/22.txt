+ SEEN_SIGN_WEAKNESS

You encounter a dune from which you can get a good view of the shimmering
building to the north. From here you can clearly see that it's surrounded by a
fence. Right in front of the fence is a sign. The sign is old and cracked, you
get the impression that a light kick would take it, and a portion of the fence,
down.
