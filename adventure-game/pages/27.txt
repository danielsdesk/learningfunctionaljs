+ ROCINANTE_DECOY

The space port ship hall is quite big, and you envision spending most of the day
looking for that one ship, but as it turns out, these ships are all called
"Rocinante". How convenient. You try the door on the closest one, and it opens
willingly.

Once in the cockpit, you find that the engine is one, and there's a "Go" button.

Hit that button!
