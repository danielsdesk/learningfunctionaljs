# The 2112 adventure game

This is the full source for the Packt Learning Functional JavaScript course.
There's more code here than what is shown in the videos, as this is a fully
working version of the adventure game.

It is highly recommended that you watch all the videos before playing with this
code. While different sections deal with different parts of the code base, the
code base will not look exactly like any of the code in the videos. The reason
for this is that this code base incorporates everything demonstrated in the
videos. Thus, code developed in section 2 is present here using tricks from
section 4 and so on. This code base should really be considered a culmination of
all the lessons thought in the videos.

For a 1:1 representation of the code in the videos, refer to individual source
files distributed alongside this code base.

To run the adventure game, enter a terminal and type out:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

You will need Node.JS installed on your system.

To run the accompanying tests, head into a terminal and type:

```sh
$ npm test
```

The adventure game comes with limited UI and a very short and limited story. You
are encouraged to expand on the game both technically and content-wise on your
own.

All of the functional helper-functions discussed in the various sections (as
well as a few more) are in the `src/fn.js` file.

I hope you enjoyed the videos and the sample application. For any questions,
feedback, or discussions, please get in touch at christian@cjohansen.no.
